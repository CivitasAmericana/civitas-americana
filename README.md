# Civitas Americana

Civitas Americana is a civic project devoted to the preservation and renewal of American self-government through constitutional structure, lawful reform, and disciplined public reasoning.

This repository publishes a set of foundational documents, accompanied by cryptographic verification materials, and a growing series of civic essays known as the Civitas Papers.

## Repository Structure

- `/pdf` — Canonical, signed PDF documents (authoritative texts)
- `/auth` — Public key, signatures, checksums, and verification instructions
- `/docs` — Readable Markdown versions and explanatory material
- `/papers` — The Civitas Papers: a series of numbered civic essays

Markdown files are provided for readability and web presentation. The PDF documents are the canonical signed versions.

## Verification

Cryptographic signatures are provided to allow independent verification of document integrity and authorship.

See:

- `/auth/VERIFY.md` — verification instructions
- `/auth/civitas-americana-publickey.asc` — public signing key

The authoritative verification materials live in the repository under `/auth`. The site hosts convenience copies; the cryptographic signatures govern.
