VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------

These documents have been digitally signed using the Civitas 
Americana PGP Key. The signatures (.asc files) are available in 
the /auth directory of the official repository.

This attestation confirms that the text, logic, and formatting 
of these documents are final as of the Genesis Commit.

The website hosts convenience copies. The canonical artifacts are the 
signed PDFs and signed checksums in the repository root /pdf and /auth.

If a website copy conflicts with repository artifacts, treat the 
repository as authoritative.


OFFICIAL CHANNELS AND COMMUNIQUE
----------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent impersonation, distortion, or unauthorized 
solicitation, Civitas Americana asserts the following:

1. Authorized Communication
   We speak only through the following channels. Any statement, 
   direct message, or solicitation originating from other 
   platforms (including but not limited to Telegram, Discord, 
   Facebook, or Instagram) is fraudulent.

   X (Twitter):  @CivitasUSA
   Email:        CivitasAmericana@pm.me
   Website:      CivitasAmericana.org or CivitasAmericana.com

2. Repository of Record
   The primary repository for these documents is GitHub:
   gitHub.com/CivitasAmericana/civitas-americana

   However, the ultimate proof of authenticity is Cryptographic 
   Signature, not hosting location.

   If the repository is removed, the documents remain valid if 
   and only if they bear a valid PGP signature from the key 
   fingerprint listed above.

3. No Solicitations
   Civitas Americana will never DM you to ask for money, seed 
   phrases, or personal information.

The Declaration and accompanying Papers were drafted to stand 
alone without commentary or defense. If the arguments within
them are sound, they require no author. If they are flawed, 
no author can save them. We have no further comment.

The text speaks for itself.

Public domain. Steal this. Restore the Republic.

Restoration, not Rupture.

Digitally Signed,

Civitas Americana
