# About the Civitas Papers

The papers/essays collected in this volume are devoted to the preservation and renewal of American self-government. They are numbered, not dated, to emphasize continuity over immediacy. There are 15 papers total, across 3 books of 5 papers each.

They proceed from the conviction that liberty is not secured by sentiment, nor by institutions alone, but by a people willing to examine power wherever it resides. The American Constitution was designed to restrain authority through structure, division, and law. Yet history has shown that no structure maintains itself automatically. Where vigilance declines, power adapts.

These papers are offered as a companion to the Declaration of Civic Breach and Renewal. Where the Declaration states principles and identifies the strain placed upon constitutional legitimacy, these papers seek to explain and apply those principles. They do not supersede the Declaration, nor do they revise it. They exist to illuminate the conditions under which its claims remain meaningful.

These essays are not intended as commentary on the news of the day, nor as partisan argument. 

Their authority rests not in authorship, but in reasoning; not in urgency, but in coherence.
