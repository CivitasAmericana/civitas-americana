## On the Duty of a Free People to Renew the Conditions of Their Own Liberty

**To The People of the United States:**

Every system of government rests, in the final analysis, not upon parchment or precedent, but upon the character and attention of The People who sustain it. Constitutions may be wisely framed and institutions carefully balanced, yet no design -- however ingenious -- can preserve liberty where vigilance has grown dormant and responsibility has been displaced by habit.

The American Constitution was born of such vigilance. It was not the product of optimism, but of experience; not an act of trust, but of restraint. Its authors understood that power is indispensable to order, yet fatal to freedom when unexamined. They therefore divided authority, limited its objects, and subjected it to law. In doing so, they sought not to perfect human nature, but to account for it.

Time has tested that design. It has endured war, expansion, and transformation beyond what its framers could have foreseen. Yet time has also revealed a truth they only dimly perceived: that structure alone cannot maintain its own meaning. Where interpretation replaces amendment, where discretion supplants law, and where convenience excuses excess, the limits of power erode without formal repeal.

The result is not tyranny in its obvious form, but something more subtle and therefore more enduring: a government that retains the language of restraint while exercising the habits of accumulation. Authority expands not by conquest, but by precedent; not by proclamation, but by acquiescence. Each generation inherits not only the Constitution, but the interpretations it tolerates.

It would be a mistake to locate this condition in any single branch or level of government. The tendency is general. National institutions grow distant, state governments grow complacent, and local authorities grow unexamined. Each justifies its conduct by necessity, efficiency, or custom. Each benefits from the inattention of those it governs. In such an environment, liberty is not overthrown -- it is neglected.

*Civitas Americana* begins from the conviction that this neglect is neither inevitable nor irreversible. It affirms that The People remain sovereign, but that sovereignty is not self-executing. To govern oneself requires more than periodic assent; it requires continuous engagement with the forms, limits, and purposes of power. Where that engagement ceases, self-government becomes a formality rather than a fact.

This project therefore does not seek to abandon the constitutional order, nor to venerate it beyond correction. It seeks instead to recover the original discipline of republican government: that power must justify itself, that authority must renew its warrant, and that liberty survives only where The People accept the burden of judgment.

The Federalists were right to insist that liberty requires structure and energy. The Anti-Federalists were right to warn that power, once granted, rarely confines itself. Both insights remain true. What history now demands is their reconciliation -- not in theory, but in practice. A republic must be strong enough to act, yet constrained enough to remain answerable; stable enough to endure, yet flexible enough to correct itself without rupture.

The purpose of the Civitas Papers is to contribute to that correction. Not by inflaming passions, but by clarifying principles; not by proposing immediate remedies, but by restoring habits of thought essential to self-rule. The aim is not to instruct The People what to think, but to remind them what it means to govern.

Liberty does not perish all at once, nor is it preserved by sentiment alone. It is maintained through attention, renewed through effort, and defended through lawful means while they remain available. The choice before us is not between change and continuity, but between deliberate renewal and accidental decay.

If the American experiment is to continue in substance as well as in name, it will do so only if The People reclaim the work of self-government as an active duty rather than a historical inheritance. That work begins not with institutions, but with understanding; not with power, but with restraint.

In that spirit, these papers are offered -- not as a final word, but as a beginning.
