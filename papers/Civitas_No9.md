## On Bureaucracy, Compliance, and the Disappearance of Responsibility

**To The People of the United States:**

The greatest harms inflicted by modern governments are rarely the work of villains. They are the result of ordinary people performing ordinary tasks within extraordinary systems. These systems are designed to ask only if an action is authorized, never if it is right. In such environments, responsibility does not vanish; it is divided, deferred, and forgotten.

Modern governance fragments responsibility until accountability disappears. Authority is distributed across agencies, departments, and committees, each insulated from the consequences of the whole. Decisions are broken into procedures; outcomes are reduced to metrics. No single actor sees the full effect of the system’s actions, and therefore no single actor feels answerable for them.

Bureaucracy rewards compliance. Advancement comes from executing protocol efficiently, not from exercising judgment. The ideal functionary follows orders. In this environment, moral reasoning is a disruption and conscience is an inefficiency.

This is how harm becomes routine. Evil need only be routinized. When actions are justified by procedure, individuals cease to evaluate the substance of their work. They learn to say, “This is not my decision,” or “I am just following the rules”. Each statement is partially true -- taken together, they produce a system in which no one acts, yet much is done.

The danger of bureaucracy lies in its capacity to excuse. By dispersing responsibility, it allows individuals to participate in actions they would never endorse alone. Complex systems make it easy to surrender agency. The individual feels irrelevant, yet his compliance remains indispensable.

This condition extends to Citizens. They comply with directives they do not understand and enforce norms that were never law. They do so out of habit. Procedure replaces judgment; obedience substitutes for responsibility. In time, resistance feels dangerous.

The most unsettling aspect of this arrangement is its moral comfort. Because no single actor intends harm, no one feels guilty. Because actions are authorized, they appear justified. Injustice persists without malice, sustained by people who consider themselves law-abiding.

This is a warning. A system that trains participants to abandon judgment in favor of compliance cannot distinguish between lawful authority and lawful abuse. It becomes capable of enforcing anything, provided the forms are properly issued.

The Constitution was designed to resist this tendency. It assumed power would be exercised by persons accountable to law and answerable to The People. It did not imagine a permanent administrative class operating by internal rules beyond public scrutiny. Where such a class emerges, responsibility dissolves and self-government recedes.

The remedy is the restoration of responsibility at every level. Citizens must be willing to question procedures that offend principle, even when those procedures are legal. Officials must be expected to exercise judgment.

A free society cannot be maintained by those who abdicate responsibility to systems they do not control. The most dangerous words in a Republic are not spoken by tyrants, but by functionaries who insist that nothing is their fault.

Injustice does not require hatred. It requires only compliance.
