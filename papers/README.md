# Civitas Papers

This directory contains the **Civitas Papers**: a series of essays offered in support of, and in dialogue with, *A Declaration of Civic Breach and Renewal*.

The papers are intended to elaborate, defend, critique, and apply the principles set forth in the Declaration through disciplined constitutional reasoning rather than partisan argument.

For the purpose, scope, and guiding principles of the Civitas Papers, see:

## Organization

- Papers are numbered sequentially (e.g., *Civitas Paper No. I*).
- They are not dated, and may be read independently or out of order.
- Authority rests in reasoning rather than authorship.

Additional papers will be added over time.
